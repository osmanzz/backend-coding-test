Purpose: This API is to insert the rider's data and stored into our sqlite and display it in this API
Change: on this API, I just used async/wait function into selection data after the insertion to make 
the query doesn't wait another. so when we query the data we can process anything that helps the business process.

Purpose: this API is for get all of the riders on our sqlite for display.
Change: Before i refactore the code. This API haven't used pagination to query the data on the sqlite.
so, i decided to use the pagination for reduce the process time on this API. The pagination itself, using
a new request with page and perpage. that will be used to decided which page and what is the last position
that want to display for the riders. on the query itself has been added the limit and offset for the limitation
and place the position of the ID with order by to sort all of the riderID.
